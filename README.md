# GoogleMapsToDB
Project for exporting pinned locations in Google Maps to database format.

  Input: .kml-file (locations exported from Google Maps)
  
  Output: .csv-file

Updated with regex search function entailing no need for input-sanitation and little to no need for output-sanitation.

Improved IO handling and added comments for customisability.
